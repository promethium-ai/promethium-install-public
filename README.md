# ‚úÖ Promethium Intelligent Edge Installation (AWS)

Promethium utilizes a hybrid application architecture. 

Promethium Control Plane. The Promethium Control Plane is hosted and managed by Promethium. The scope of the control plane is; 

- Authentication
- Metadata
- Promethium‚Äôs agentic layer
- Application orchestration
- Application Telemetry

Promethium Data Plane (Intelligent Edge). The Promethium Data Plane is installed within the customers cloud provider as a private cluster. The data plane has connectivity to all data platforms. This ensures all data remains within the customers private network. Data exposed to an end user flows directly from the data plane to the users browser requiring all users to be part of the the customers private network. No data is exposed to the Promethium Control Plane. Customer is responsible for the management and monitoring of the Data Plane infrastructure. Promethium is responsible for the Application layer management and monitoring. The scope of the Data Plane is;

- Data Connections
- Metadata Discovery
- Federated Query
- Pipeline Orchestration
- Data APIs

This repository contains the artifacts your team needs to install the Promethium Intelligent Edge in your AWS environment. It is designed for security, consistency, and minimal operational overhead.
